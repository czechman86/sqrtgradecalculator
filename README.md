Overview: This project features a web-based grade curve calculator that applies the square root curve methodology. It was developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Development Method: The calculator was created as part of an interactive code-along session guided by an AI instructor. Rather than copying and pasting the provided code, I manually entered each line, intentionally tracing the logic. This process introduced several bugs, which I subsequently debugged, enhancing my understanding of the technologies involved.

Learner’s Background: As a computer science educator with multiple certifications in Python and other programming languages, I possess a strong foundation in coding principles. However, to acquire proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—skills essential for an upcoming professional role—I opted for an innovative learning approach. Instead of traditional methods, I chose to leverage AI-assisted instruction, finding it aligns effectively with my learning style and yields satisfactory results.

AI Assistance Disclosure: While the initial code was generated through AI guidance, the hands-on process of manually implementing and troubleshooting it ensured meaningful skill development. This method reflects my commitment to adapting modern tools for professional growth.

Note: The code’s origin as part of an AI-supported code-along is transparently acknowledged. Should this approach raise concerns, please refrain from using the project.
