# sqrtgradecalculator
A grade curve calculator for applying the sqrt curve written in html, css, and javascript. 

I am attempting to learn html, css, and javascript by using an AI teacher. This was a code along assignment I did with the AI, therefore, the code is AI generated. However, I did not simply copy and paste the AI code into VSCode, isntead, I entered in each line, tracing it, and created quite a bit of bugs along the way, which I had to solve. 

Also, as a CS teacher, and a holder of many Python and other coding related certs, I certainly do understand how coding works, but didn't want to go the traditional route for learning these new languages, and decided that I would test the 'future' out. To be honest, I am quite happy with the results so far.

For me, this works, as this is how I learn, and I will need to learn html, css, and javascript for an upcoming job I have.

If you do not like that this was a code produced in a code along lesson with AI, please do not use it.
